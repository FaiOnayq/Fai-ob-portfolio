            "description": "At TAHAKOM, I contributed to the development of a computer vision project, where I handled a full-scale data pipeline for a recognition model. My work involved the process of transforming approximately 100,000 surveillance images and fine-tuned the PyTorch models on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster utilizing SSH for remote access and job management to efficiently train and optimize deep learning models. This work resulted in an 8% performance increase for the model. I further supported the project by conducting thorough analyzing model performance and creating reports to inform the team's strategic direction.",
